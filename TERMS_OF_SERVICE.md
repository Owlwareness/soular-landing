## Agreement to Terms

By downloading, accessing, or using Soular Love, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you don't agree, don't use the app. Simple as that.

These terms are a legal agreement between you and CAIVE LLC ("we," "us," "our"). Please read them.

## 1. What Soular Is

Soular Love is a connection app where meaningful conversations create visual star constellations. We use AI to analyze the depth of your exchanges and build beautiful maps of your connections.

**What we provide:**
- Daily matching with other users
- Real-time messaging
- AI-powered conversation analysis
- Constellation visualizations of connection depth
- Face reveal after demonstrating authentic connection

**What we don't guarantee:**
- That you'll find a connection
- That matches will respond
- That the AI analysis will be perfect
- Anything beyond the service as described

---

## 2. Eligibility

To use Soular, you must:

- Be at least 18 years old
- Provide accurate information during signup
- Have the legal capacity to enter this agreement
- Not be prohibited from using the service under applicable law
- Not have been previously banned from Soular

One account per person. Creating multiple accounts will result in termination.

---

## 3. Your Account

**You're responsible for:**
- Keeping your login credentials secure
- All activity under your account
- Providing accurate profile information
- Updating your information if it changes

**Don't share your account.** If you think someone has accessed your account without permission, contact us immediately.

---

## 4. How Soular Works

### Matching
- You receive one new match per day
- Matches expire after 24 hours if no meaningful conversation occurs
- You can only be matched with users you haven't blocked (and who haven't blocked you)

### Conversations
- Messages are analyzed by AI to determine conversation depth
- Meaningful exchanges create "stars" in your shared constellation
- Your messages may be used to extract themes for your personal constellation

### Face Reveal
- Profile photos are hidden initially
- Photos become visible after reaching 4 stars (demonstrating authentic connection)
- This is automatic and cannot be manually triggered

### Star Forge
- Themes from your conversations may appear as prompts on your home screen
- Responding to these prompts creates stars in your personal constellation
- Minimum 80 characters required for meaningful responses

---

## 5. Acceptable Use

**Do:**
- Be authentic and respectful
- Report concerning behavior
- Use the app for genuine connection

**Don't:**
- Harass, threaten, or abuse other users
- Send spam or commercial solicitations
- Share explicit, violent, or illegal content
- Impersonate others or create fake profiles
- Attempt to circumvent safety features
- Use automated systems or bots
- Reverse engineer or hack the app
- Use Soular if you're under 18
- Violate any applicable laws

Violation of these rules may result in immediate account termination.

## 6. Content You Create

### Your Content
You retain ownership of the messages, photos, and other content you create on Soular.

### License to Us
By using Soular, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, display, and process your content as necessary to provide the service. This includes:
- Storing and displaying your messages to your matches
- Processing your conversations through AI analysis
- Creating constellation visualizations from your content
- Displaying your profile to potential and current matches

This license ends when you delete your content or account.

### AI-Generated Content
Constellation data, star labels, and themes generated by our AI from your conversations are derived works. You can view and enjoy them, but they're part of the Soular service.

---

## 7. Blocking and Reporting

### Blocking
- You can block any user at any time
- Blocking immediately ends the connection and deletes all shared data
- Blocked users cannot match with you again (ever)
- Blocking is invisible to the blocked user

### Reporting
- You can report users for harassment, inappropriate content, spam, or other violations
- Reports include a snapshot of recent messages for review
- Reporting automatically blocks the reported user
- False reports may result in action against your account

We review reports and take appropriate action, which may include warning or banning the reported user.

---

## 8. Account Termination

### By You
You can delete your account anytime from Settings. Deletion is immediate and permanent. All your data will be erased.

### By Us
We may suspend or terminate your account if you:
- Violate these terms
- Engage in harmful behavior
- Create legal liability for us
- Are reported multiple times

We may also terminate accounts that are inactive for extended periods.

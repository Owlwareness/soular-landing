## The Short Version

We built Soular Love to help people connect authentically. Your data exists to make that happen - not to sell, not to advertise, not to exploit. We use AI to understand the depth of your conversations and create beautiful visualizations of your connections. That's it.

When you delete your account, everything goes with it. Immediately. No 90-day holds, no archives, no "we might keep some stuff." Gone.

## 1. Who We Are

Soular Love is operated by CAIVE LLC. When we say "we," "us," or "our," we mean CAIVE LLC. When we say "you" or "your," we mean you, the person using Soular Love.

## 4. AI and Your Conversations

Soular uses artificial intelligence (Google's Gemini model via OpenRouter) to:

- Determine if conversations have meaningful depth
- Extract themes and create star visualizations
- Generate follow-up questions for personal reflection

**How it works:** When you chat with a match, our AI reads the conversation to understand if both people are sharing authentically. If so, it creates "stars" representing the themes you've explored together. This is core to how Soular works.

**What we don't do:** We don't train AI models on your conversations. We don't store conversation analysis beyond what's needed for your constellation. We don't share your messages with AI providers for any purpose other than real-time analysis.

---

## 5. How We Share Your Information

### With Your Matches
- Your display name
- Your profile photo (only after face reveal is unlocked)
- Messages you send them
- Shared constellation data

### With Service Providers

| Provider | Purpose | Data Shared |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Supabase | Database, authentication, file storage | Account data, messages, constellation data |
| OpenRouter/Google Gemini | AI conversation analysis | Message content (processed, not stored by them) |
| Expo | Push notifications | Push tokens, notification content |
| Resend | Admin email alerts | Report details (admin only) |

These providers process data on our behalf and are contractually bound to protect it.

### For Legal Reasons
We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or to protect the safety of our users or the public.

### We Never Sell Your Data
Period. No exceptions. No "trusted partners." No "anonymized data sets." Never.

## 6. Data Retention

**Active Accounts:** We retain your data while your account is active.

**Deleted Accounts:** When you delete your account, we immediately and permanently delete:
- Your profile and all personal information
- All your messages
- Your constellation data
- Your profile photo
- Your authentication credentials
- All connection records

This deletion is immediate and irreversible. We use cascade deletion - when your account goes, everything connected to it goes too.

**Expired Connections:** Match data expires after 24 hours if no meaningful conversation occurs.

**Reports:** If you report someone (or are reported), we retain a snapshot of relevant messages for safety review. This is deleted if the report is resolved or the reported account is deleted.

---

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

**Access Your Data:** You can view your profile information, messages, and constellation data within the app.

**Update Your Data:** You can update your name, photo, and other profile information anytime.

**Delete Your Data:** You can delete your entire account from Settings. This is immediate and permanent.

**Notification Preferences:** You can disable push notifications through your device settings.

**California Residents (CCPA):** You have the right to know what data we collect, request deletion, and opt out of data sales (we don't sell data, so this is already satisfied).

**European Residents (GDPR):** You have rights to access, rectification, erasure, data portability, and to object to processing. Contact us to exercise these rights.

## 8. Data Security

We protect your data with:

- **Encryption:** All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest
- **Row-Level Security:** Database policies ensure you can only access your own data
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens verify every request
- **Rate Limiting:** Protection against abuse and attacks
- **Input Sanitization:** Prevention of injection attacks
- **Limited Access:** Only essential personnel can access the database

No system is 100% secure. If we discover a breach affecting your data, we'll notify you promptly.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Soular is not intended for anyone under 18. We verify age during signup and do not knowingly collect information from minors. If we learn we've collected data from someone under 18, we'll delete it immediately.

## 10. International Data Transfers

Your data may be processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers operate. By using Soular, you consent to this transfer. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.
